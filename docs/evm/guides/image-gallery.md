# Build a Fully-Onchain Image Gallery

If you search for resources on how to store images of any significant size onchain, you'll be told it's either prohibitively expensive or even completely impossible.  

## Objectives

After completing this guide, you'll be able to:

* 3-5 appropriate level Bloom's taxonomy verb objectives.
* BAD: Know how arrays work.
* GOOD: Construct a function to filter an array of numbers and only return the even ones.
* Do **not** try to wordsmith these.  If you need to start four in a row with _write_, do it.
* Learning objectives have periods at the end.

## Prerequisites

### Next.js and Modern Frontend Development

This tutorial uses [Next.js].  You don't need to be an expert, but it's helpful to be comfortable with development using a current React framework.  You'll be on your own to select and use a package manager, manage Node versions, and other frontend environment tasks.  If you don't have your own preference, you can just follow along with us and use [Yarn].

### Solidity

You don't need to be an expert, but you should be comfortable writing code in [Solidity].  You can use [Hardhat], [Foundry], or even [Remix].

## The Name of A Major Section in Sentence Case

:::info[Action]

Anything that is a direct instruction to complete tasks in the tutorial goes in one of these.

:::

```cadence
//Code snippets will often follow Action boxes, but may be put anywhere appropriate.
access(all) fun() foo: String {
	return "bar";
}
```

### The Name of A Minor Section in Sentence Case

Generally, avoid going with smaller sub-sections than H3/###
